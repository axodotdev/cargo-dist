description: How to use dist within your project structure

import { Aside,FileTree,Tabs,TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

All dist projects, regardless of how many packages they may contain, are
considered workspaces. A minimalist dist project would be a workspace that contains
a single package.

## `dist-workspace.toml`

`dist` infers your project structure based on the location of the `dist-workspace.toml`
file. This file is usually at the root of your repo, however, if you only ever intend
to use `dist` on a single project or set of projects within your repo, you can
place the `dist-workspace.toml` at the root of that part of the repo structure.

<Aside type="note">
Before version 1.0, `dist` allowed Rust users to put all configuration in their
`Cargo.toml` file. If you are still on an early version and need help updating,
you can check out our documentation on [migrating configuration](TODO).

## Installers

`dist` offers several installer types to create a streamlined experience for
users on a variety of platforms. If you don't see your favorite method listed
here, take a look at the [community-contirbuted installers](#community-installers).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Shell">
    ```shell
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/axodotdev/dist/releases/latest/download/dist-installer.sh | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Powershell">
    ```powershell
    powershell -c "irm https://github.com/axodotdev/dist/releases/latest/download/dist-installer.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Homebrew">
    ```shell
    brew install axodotdev/tap/dist
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
    npm install @axodotdev/dist
    ```
  </TabItem>

`dist` installers handle fetching binaries and putting them in the correct install
location (which you can [customize](#customizing)). They also ensure that the install
location is appropriately on your PATH and will update any dotfiles that may be
present. They also create an "install receipt" which enables our [updater](/start/update).

<Aside type="tip">
`dist` is packaged and distributed with `dist` so installing `dist` is also using `dist`!
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
`dist`'s installers are binary fetching installers- which means that they execute
a light wrapper script which fetches an artifact that contains [pre-built binary](#pre-built-binaries)
from a remote host. Those binaries are always available and inspectable on the
[latest release](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/latest) We also
provide [checksums](#checksums) for all binary assets and installers as well as [provenance attestation](#provenance)
for all artifacts.
</Aside>

### Customizing

`dist`'s installers enable end users to customize how software is installed on
their machine.

- `DIST_INSTALL_DIR`: This environment variable tells the installer what to use
as the "base" directory for the installation task. For example, if you set this
variable to `/mydir` we will install `dist`'s binaries in `/mydir/bin`.

## Pre-built binaries

We currently build and provide pre-built binaries for a variety of platforms.
These are the same binaries that our installers fetch.

### Platform support

- Apple Silicon macOS
- Intel maxOS
- x64 Windows
- ARM64 Linux
- x64 Linux
- ARM64 MUSL Linux (static)
- x64 MUSL Linux (static)

If you would like to request additional platform support, please [file an issue](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/new)!

### Checksums

We also generate checksums to allow user to independently verify the integrity
of the pre-built binaries that we provide. To do so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```shell
    sha256sum -c sha256.sum
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    ```shell
    shasum -a256 -c sha256.sum
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    certutil -hashfile sha256.sum SHA256   
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Provenance 

<Aside type="note">
    Artifact attestations enable you to increase the supply chain security of your builds by establishing where and how your software was built.
</Aside>

All artifacts generated in a `dist` release have attestations generated with [GitHub Artifact Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations).
These can be verified by using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```shell
gh attestation verify <file-path of downloaded artifact> --repo axodotdev/dist
```

You can also download the attestation from GitHub and verify against that directly:

```shell
gh attestation verify <file-path of downloaded artifact> --bundle <file-path of downloaded attestation>
```

## Build from source

For users who need to `dist` to work on platforms that we do not yet provide
pre-built binaries for, you will need to build from source. Thankfully, `dist`
is and always will be open soruce, licensed under a dual MIT/Apache2.0 license.

<Aside type="tip">
`dist` is written in Rust and uses `cargo` to build. To install Rust and `cargo`
visit: https://rustup.rs/.

`dist` requires stable Rust, version 0.79 or greater.
</Aside>

Once you have a Rust toolchain set up, run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:axodotdev/dist.git
cd dist
cargo install cargo-dist --locked
```

## Community installers

These methods are contributed by the `dist` community:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Arch (extra)">
    ```shell
    pacman -S cargo-dist
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Nix">
    ```shell
    nix-env -i cargo-dist
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cargo-binstall">
    ```shell
    cargo binstall cargo-dist
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

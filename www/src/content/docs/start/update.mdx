description: How to update your version of dist

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

`dist` ships with functionality to self update. To update to the latest version,
run:

```shell
dist selfupdate
```

## Updating configuration

After you run this command, `dist` will automatically run `dist init` which will
update your [configuration](/start/config). 

`dist init` is smart, so it will "remember" your current configuration and pre-fill
you previous answers.

`dist init` is interactive and we recommend you manually working through the
answers after the updating because it will help you discover new features, however,
you can instruct `dist init` to simply accept all previous answers by passing
`-y` or `--yes`.

<Aside type="tip">
To fully update you'll need to commit the newly generated configuration and workflow
to your repo.

## Version

To update to a particular version of `dist` (either newer or older), you can pass
the `--version` flag:

```shell
dist selfupdate --version 0.0.1
```

<Aside type="tip">
Many projects tag their releases with the version number preceded with a `v`, e.g.
version `0.1.0` would be tagged `v0.1.0`. When using this feature, make sure to NOT
precede the version number with a `v`.

<Aside type="note">
When you specify a specific version it can be either a stable or pre-release,
without needing to pass the `--prerelease` flag.
</Aside>

## Pre-releases

To update to the latest version, including prereleases, you can pass `--prerelease`
flag:

```shell
dist selfupdate --prerelease
```

<Aside type="caution">
Beware- `cargo-dist` pre-releases are not stable and often are cut on feature
branches and not off of `main`.

If you use this functionality, make sure you know what you are doing!

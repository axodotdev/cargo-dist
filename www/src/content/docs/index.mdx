## What?

`dist` is a developer tool that generates and manages your release process, end-to-end, from build to announce by:

- Managing your build targets, system dependencies, and other preferences
- Building and bundling your binaries and other artifacts
- Generating packaging wrappers and metadata, and
- Orchestrating the hosting, publishing, and announcing tasks associated with your release. 

`dist` does this by *generating CI/CD workflows* for you. No more writing YAML!

`dist` is distributed with `dist`. Check out an example [release](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/tag/v0.23.0) and [configuration](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L75-L111).

## Install the latest version

## How it works

<Steps>

1. Run `dist init` and set your distribution preferences

    ```shell
    let's setup your cargo-dist config...

    ? what platforms do you want to build for?
    (select with arrow keys and space, submit with enter) â€º
        [x] Apple Silicon macOS (aarch64-apple-darwin)
        [x] Intel macOS (x86_64-apple-darwin)
        [x] x64 Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
        [ ] x64 MUSL Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-musl)
        [x] x64 Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)
    ```

1. Commit the generated workflow file

    ```shell
    git add .github/workflows/release.yml
    git commit -m "release: add cargo-dist"
    ```

1. Trigger your workflow by pushing a tag or through manual dispatch!

    ```shell
    git tag v0.1.0
    ```

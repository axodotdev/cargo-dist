<h2>ZIP archive improvements</h2>
<p>Previous versions of dist produced uncompressed ZIP archives which meant that they were much larger than necessary. ZIP archives are now compressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @trim21 <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/axoasset/pull/312" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: enable compression on zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In previous versions, ZIP archives were only suitable for Windows binaries because they didn't preserve executable permissions. ZIP archives now correctly preserve extended Unix permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @mistydemeo <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/axoasset/pull/311" rel="noopener noreferrer">fix: preserve Unix permissions in ZIPs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The npm installer previously used the <code>unzip</code> commandline utility to unpack ZIP archives on Windows. This isn't available in all installations, so some users would experience errors at install time. We've improved this by switching to the builtin PowerShell <code>Expand-Archive</code> cmdlet.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @jacobtread
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/2005" rel="noopener noreferrer">fix: windows use powershell to extract zip file</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/2046" rel="noopener noreferrer">fix: platform.includes bug</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional installer configuration environment variables</h2>
<p>dist's installers are configurable using a variety of different environment variables, but in previous versions only some of these would be branded with your app's name. We now provide branded versions of all of the other environment variables as well. The previous unbranded environment variables will continue to work. The new variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>${APP_NAME}_DOWNLOAD_URL</code></li>
<li><code>${APP_NAME}_PRINT_QUIET</code></li>
<li><code>${APP_NAME}_PRINT_VERBOSE</code></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist/pull/46" rel="noopener noreferrer">make every last INSTALLER_ variable have a branded version</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist/pull/48" rel="noopener noreferrer">support <code>{BRAND}_DOWNLOAD_URL</code> in ps1 installer</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature previously appeared in version 0.28.7 of Astral's fork.</p>
<h2>Shell installer refuses to use Snap-installed curl</h2>
<p>The shell installers will now refuse to fetch archives using a copy of curl installed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap</a> package manager for Ubuntu. Snap-installed copies of curl have limitations on their ability to write downloaded files to disk which makes them unsuitable for dist's installers. If a Snap-installed curl is detected, the installer will try to fall back to using another download tool; if no other tool is present, a message will be shown to the user and the installation will abort.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @konstin <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist/pull/28" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avoid snap curl</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature previously appeared in version 0.28.5 of Astral's fork.</p>
<h2>PowerShell installer now supports proxies</h2>
<p>The PowerShell installer now respects the <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> and <code>ANY_PROXY</code> environment variables and uses them to configure a proxy when fetching artifacts. These were already supported by the shell installer.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @zanieb and @zsol <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/2078" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powershell installer: respect HTTPS_PROXY and ANY_PROXY env vars</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>macOS code signing now supports the <code>--options</code> flag</h2>
<p>When using the experimental macOS codesigning feature, users can now specify a value to be passed to the <code>--options</code> flag using the <code>CODESIGN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @jackkleeman <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1743" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support --options in mac code signing</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux arm64 GitHub Actions builds now use native arm64 runners by default</h2>
<p>In previous versions of dist, we used cross-compilation to build arm64 Linux binaries from an x86_64 host. GitHub now provides free native arm64 runners, so we've switched to using these by default. Users can still use cross-compilation if they prefer by specifying the x86_64 runners using the <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#custom-runners" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom runners feature</a> in the dist config.</p>
<h2>GitHub Actions artifact attestations can now be customized</h2>
<p>It's now possible to customize exactly which artifacts are attested, and which phase of the build process to perform the attestations in. Currently, customizing which artifacts to attest requires the attestation to happen during the <code>host</code> phase; this restriction may be lifted in the future.</p>
<p>To specify which artifacts to attest, you can use a list of globs; any artifacts matching any of those globs will receive an attestation. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#263238;"><span style="color:#f07178;">github-attestations-phase </span><span style="color:#89ddff;">= "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">host</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">"
</span><span style="color:#f07178;">github-attestations-filters </span><span style="color:#89ddff;">= ["</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">*.json</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">", "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">*.sh</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">", "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">*.ps1</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">", "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">*.zip</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">", "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">*.tar.gz</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">"]
</span></pre>

<h2>Linux arm64 GitHub Actions builds now use native arm64 runners by default</h2>
<p>In previous versions of dist, we used cross-compilation to build arm64 Linux binaries from an x86_64 host. GitHub now provides free native arm64 runners, so we've switched to using these by default. Users can still use cross-compilation if they prefer by specifying the x86_64 runners using the <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#custom-runners" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom runners feature</a> in the dist config.</p>
<h2>GitHub Actions artifact attestations can now be customized</h2>
<p>It's now possible to customize exactly which artifacts are attested, and which phase of the build process to perform the attestations in. Currently, customizing which artifacts to attest requires the attestation to happen during the <code>host</code> phase; this restriction may be lifted in the future.</p>
<p>To specify which artifacts to attest, you can use a list of globs; any artifacts matching any of those globs will receive an attestation. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#263238;"><span style="color:#f07178;">github-attestations-phase </span><span style="color:#89ddff;">= "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">host</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">"

<h2>Additional installer configuration environment variables</h2>
<p>dist's installers are configurable using a variety of different environment variables, but in previous versions only some of these would be branded with your app's name.

It also removes support for Axo Releases.</p>
<h2>Pinning GitHub Actions to commits</h2>
<p>By default, dist uses Actions via floating versioned tags such as <code>actions/checkout@v4</code>. Users with specific security requirements may instead want to pin these to specific commits so that they know exactly which version will be run. This release provides configuration to allow users to specify which commit to use for a given action. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#pinned-actions-commits" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Recursive source tarballs, including the contents of submodules</h2>
<p>While we've had support for source tarballs since <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/tag/v0.5.0" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.5.0</a>, those tarballs have been limited to the contents of the base repository and didn't contain the contents of submodules. (This is a limitation of the <code>git archive</code> tool that we use to generate them.) This release adds support for recursive tarballs that include the contents of submodules as well. This feature is opt-in and can be enabled with the <code>recursive-tarballs = true</code> setting. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#recursive-tarball" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1966" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add recursive-tarballs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Support cross-compiling from Windows to Windows</h2>
<p>In previous versions, dist would refuse to cross-compile from one Windows architecture to another. This release fixes that and allows the build to be attempted. We still default to cross-compiling via <code>cargo-xwin</code>; users who would like to try this will need to configure their builds to use a Windows runner. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#263238;"><span style="color:#89ddff;">[dist.github-custom-runners.aarch64-pc-windows-msvc]
</span><span style="color:#f07178;">runner </span><span style="color:#89ddff;">= "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">windows-2025</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">"

<li>impl @baszalmstra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1962" rel="noopener noreferrer">fix: allow cross compiling from windows to windows</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Installer improvements</h2>
<p>We've improved compatibility for the shell installer by bringing in newer changes from the Rustup installer it was originally based on. We've also improved compatibility with Linux distributions that don't use the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1958" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: improve installer.sh with changes from rustup</a></li>
<li>impl @konstin <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1968" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: support Linux distros that don't set HOME</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>BYO GitHub bearer token for installers</h2>
<p>In addition to the above, we now allow users to bring their own GitHub token to be used when fetching tarballs from GitHub. This is useful for users who are often rate-limited when downloading artifacts or who need to fetch artifacts from private repositories. Like our other environment variables, this is branded with your application's name in the format <code>{APP_NAME}_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. This environment variable is supported in both the shell and PowerShell installers. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/installers/usage.html?highlight=bearer#github-bearer-token" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1956" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add <code>{APP_NAME}_GITHUB_TOKEN</code> install env-var</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reduce unnecessary credentials persistence in Actions config</h2>
<p>This release includes some tweaks to generated Actions config in order to reduce the risk of accidentally persisting credentials longer in the run than necessary. This is always enabled and doesn't require configuration to opt into.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1948" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add persist-credentials: false to checkouts</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Allow overriding binaries per-platform</h2>
<p>It's now possible to override the set of binaries to install on a per-platform basis. For example, a project with three binaries may choose to only install two of them on Windows, or may choose to provide an extra binary on other platforms. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#binaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1946" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: allow overriding per-platform binaries</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>New setting for overriding packages to dist</h2>
<p>A new top-level option, <code>packages</code>, allows specifying a list of exactly which packages should be disted. This overrides any individual <code>dist = true</code> or <code>dist = false</code> set in individual packages, and can be easier to reason about. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html?highlight=packages#packages" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1960" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add packages override for externally setting dist=true/false</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overriding package versions</h2>
<p>The new top-level <code>version</code> option overrides the individually-configuredversions for every package and instead causes dist to assume every package has the specified version. For more information, see <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<h2>BYO GitHub bearer token for installers</h2>
<p>In addition to the above, we now allow users to bring their own GitHub token to be used when fetching tarballs from GitHub. This is useful for users who are often rate-limited when downloading artifacts or who need to fetch artifacts from private repositories. Like our other environment variables, this is branded with your application's name in the format <code>{APP_NAME}_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. This environment variable is supported in both the shell and PowerShell installers. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/installers/usage.html?highlight=bearer#github-bearer-token" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Reduce unnecessary credentials persistence in Actions config</h2>
<p>This release includes some tweaks to generated Actions config in order to reduce the risk of accidentally persisting credentials longer in the run than necessary. This is always enabled and doesn't require configuration to opt into.</p>

<h2>Allow overriding binaries per-platform</h2>
<p>It's now possible to override the set of binaries to install on a per-platform basis. For example, a project with three binaries may choose to only install two of them on Windows, or may choose to provide an extra binary on other platforms. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#binaries" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<h2>New setting for overriding packages to dist</h2>
<p>A new top-level option, <code>packages</code>, allows specifying a list of exactly which packages should be disted. This overrides any individual <code>dist = true</code> or <code>dist = false</code> set in individual packages, and can be easier to reason about. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html?highlight=packages#packages" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Overriding package versions</h2>
<p>The new top-level <code>version</code> option overrides the individually-configuredversions for every package and instead causes dist to assume every package has the specified version. For more information, see <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>

It also removes support for Axo Releases.</p>
<h2>Pinning GitHub Actions to commits</h2>
<p>By default, dist uses Actions via floating versioned tags such as <code>actions/checkout@v4</code>. Users with specific security requirements may instead want to pin these to specific commits so that they know exactly which version will be run. This release provides configuration to allow users to specify which commit to use for a given action. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#pinned-actions-commits" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1944" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add github-action-commits config</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Recursive source tarballs, including the contents of submodules</h2>
<p>While we've had support for source tarballs since <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/tag/v0.5.0" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.5.0</a>, those tarballs have been limited to the contents of the base repository and didn't contain the contents of submodules. (This is a limitation of the <code>git archive</code> tool that we use to generate them.) This release adds support for recursive tarballs that include the contents of submodules as well. This feature is opt-in and can be enabled with the <code>recursive-tarballs = true</code> setting. For more information, see <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#recursive-tarball" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1966" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: add recursive-tarballs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Support cross-compiling from Windows to Windows</h2>
<p>In previous versions, dist would refuse to cross-compile from one Windows architecture to another. This release fixes that and allows the build to be attempted. We still default to cross-compiling via <code>cargo-xwin</code>; users who would like to try this will need to configure their builds to use a Windows runner. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#263238;"><span style="color:#89ddff;">[dist.github-custom-runners.aarch64-pc-windows-msvc]
</span><span style="color:#f07178;">runner </span><span style="color:#89ddff;">= "</span><span style="color:#c3e88d;">windows-2025</span><span style="color:#89ddff;">"
</span></pre>

<li>impl @baszalmstra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1962" rel="noopener noreferrer">fix: allow cross compiling from windows to windows</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Installer improvements</h2>
<p>We've improved compatibility for the shell installer by bringing in newer changes from the Rustup installer it was originally based on. We've also improved compatibility with Linux distributions that don't use the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @Gankra <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1958" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: improve installer.sh with changes from rustup</a></li>

We've also made some behind-the-scenes changes which most users won't notice yet - keep an eye out for our next major release!</p>
<h2>PowerShell improvements</h2>
<p>While we've always updated the user's <code>Path</code> variable for them, in the past the user had to reboot their system for the change to be reflected or temporarily add the installation directory to the <code>Path</code> themselves. Starting in 0.28.0, we now only require you to restart your shell for the change to take effect, not the entire system. We've also made improvements to our handling of this variable to better support users whose <code>Path</code> contained variable expansions.</p>
<p>Thanks to open source contributor @DavisVaughan, who did extensive research as well as writing the feature!</p>

This release contains a few new features and fixes.</p>
<h2>Support for XDG_CONFIG_HOME</h2>
<p>We've always supported standard OS configuration paths. This release adds support for <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, an <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/#variables" rel="noopener noreferrer">environment variable defined in the XDG Base Directory Specification</a>, in order to allow users to override that default. We support this on all platforms, even Windows. Installers created with dist 0.27.0 or later will respect this environment variable and place install receipts in that path; updaters using axoupdater 0.9.0 or later will respect that variable when searching for the receipt.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @brennanfee, @mistydemeo <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1655" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: support XDG_CONFIG_HOME</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved handling of missing build dependencies</h2>
<p>While we've always reported if mandatory tools are missing, we previously would only check for their existence right before we'd use them. This made it hard to judge exactly when required tools might be absent, and meant we'd only report about a single tool at a time. With this release, we now check for these tools up front and we check for every tool your build will need simultaneously. This allows us to tell you about <em>every</em> missing tool in one message, and before the builds themselves begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @duckinator <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1640" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fail early if required tools can't be found.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved generic config handling</h2>
<p>Since we shipped the new config format, <code>dist-workspace.toml</code>, we've been providing some spurious messages for non-Rust builds using just a <code>dist.toml</code> file. In this release, we now migrate users with <code>dist.toml</code>-alone apps to <code>dist-workspace.toml</code>. This conversion is automatic and requires no user input; it will happen when using <code>dist init</code> to upgrade to a new release.</p>
<ul>
<li>impl @mistydemeo <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1656" rel="noopener noreferrer">feat: migrate dist.toml to dist-workspace.toml</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Stabilizing the standalone updater we ship</h2>
<p>In the past, we always shipped the latest version of the standalone updater provided via <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater" rel="noopener noreferrer">axoupdater</a>. This meant that, if a new version of axoupdater was released after a given version of dist, your app would receive that latest version. As we've stabilized the updater's feature set, we feel that end users are deriving less benefit from this rolling release schedule and it would be more helpful to provide a fixed, known-good stable release instead.</p>
<p>Beginning with this release, dist will always package the same version of axoupdater when building and shipping your app. If you prefer the old behaviour, and would like to receive whatever's the latest, you can set <code>always-use-latest-updater = true</code> in your configuration.</p>

//! Computing the Announcement (and Changelogs)
//!
//! The main entrypoints are `select_tag` and `DistGraphBuilder::compute_announcement_info`,
//! which should be used in that order.
//!
//!
//! # The Tag (Selection)
//!
//! The "tag" is dist slang for "what are we actually announcing", in reference
//! to the fact that the original/primary mode of operation in dist was to
//! push a commit to your repo with a git tag, which we would use as a selector
//! for the packages we're publishing.
//!
//! For instance, `v1.0.0` would select all packages that have the version 1.0.0,
//! while `my-package-v1.0.0` would select `my-package` (and error if it's not 1.0.0).
//! We call `v1.0.0` a "universal" or "version" tag, and `my-package-v1.0.0` a
//! "single-package" tag. There are many other supported formats but they are
//! equivalent to this form.
//!
//! In `select_tag`, "selecting" the tag determines the following facts:
//!
//! * What is the git tag
//! * What is the version we're releasing
//! * Whether it's a prerelease
//! * What packages are we releasing
//!
//! Note that version is *singular* here. It is assumed by dist that every
//! announcement is for a single "version", and all packages that are part of that
//! announcement should therefore have that single version.
//!
//! This tag is used to ensure every invocation of dist in the graph
//! of CI jobs we kick off agrees on what's being done, with each one being passed the
//! value via --tag.
//!
//!
//! ## TagMode
//!
//! The [`TagMode`][] determines the primary semantics of tag selection.
//!
//! The primary mode is [`TagMode::Select`][], where we were given a tag and need to parse it as
//! the kind of selector described above. The parsing is sensitive to the packages that are in
//! the workspace, because we try to be pretty flexible about tag formats, and that's the most
//! reliable way to avoid ambiguities. This code is factored out to a separate library called
//! [`axotag`][], because we wanted other tools to be able to validate/agree on the results
//! (particularly axo Releases to avoid messes where tag and version wildly disagreed).
//!
//! When `axotag` is invoked, it will select the packages/versions we're working with.
//!
//! In all other forms we start with all packages enabled, and filter them down subsequently.
//! Typically this is in [`TagMode::Infer`][], which is used when no --tag is passed,
//! and we need to guess at a "plausible" tag based on the packages in the workspace.
//! Typically this would be "oh all the packages we care about are 1.2.7,
//! so let's use v1.2.7 as the tag".
//!
//! `Infer` in turn has two implicit submodes based on [`TagSettings::needs_coherence`][].
//! When set to true, this suggests we're using a command like `plan` which just wants to
//! show you info about everything, so we don't *really* care about a coherent tag.
//!
//! ## Package Selection
//!
//! ### Distability
//!
//! Distability of a package (whether to "dist") is... less well-formed of a notion than one
//! would like. It's, I think, informative to walk through it *historically*.
//!
//! The original idea was we'd see your cargo workspace, find all the packages with binaries
//! in them, and then build and publish those. Of course, you don't want to dist things with
//! cargo's `publish = false` because those are probably examples/wip/internal.
//!
//! But actually for whatever reason sometimes you do want to avoid the cargo registry and
//! still "dist" them. So for we added `dist=true/false` to override the `publish=true/false` signal
//! from cargo.
//!
//! Also, even though the *main* thing we do is publish apps and make installers for them,
//! people want to tag pure-source library releases, and they wanted GitHub Releases to still get
//! made. This introduced probably the nastiest wrench in the system, the "Library Mode",
//! where dist knows it's kinda doing nothing but has to go through some of the motions,
//! and the CI needs to skip over huge chunks.
//!
//! Library Mode is triggered by a single-package tag. **IT BYPASSES DISTABILITY**,
//! because "has apps" was one of the criteria of distability. This is *messed up*
//! and makes the system make no sense. This should be changed and rationalized.
//! If I could I might just drop support for this feature?
//!
//! After this we added "force" modes for people who don't want to keep their packages
//! versioned in lockstep, where we pretend the packages have the given version.
//! This mode just selects all the distable packages.

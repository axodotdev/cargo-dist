//! Code to compute the tasks cargo-dist should do
//!
//! This is the heart and soul of cargo-dist, and ideally the [`gather_work`][] function
//! should compute every minute detail dist will perform ahead of time. This is done with
//! the DistGraphBuilder, which roughly builds up the work to do as follows:
//!
//! 1. [`config::get_project`][]: find out everything we want to know about the workspace (binaries, configs, etc)
//! 2. compute the TargetTriples we're interested based on ArtifactMode and target configs/flags
//! 3. add Releases for all the binaries selected by the above steps
//! 4. for each TargetTriple, create a ReleaseVariant of each Release
//! 5. add target-specific Binaries to each ReleaseVariant
//! 6. add Artifacts to each Release, which will be propagated to each ReleaseVariant as necessary
//!   1. add archives, propagated to ReleaseVariants
//!   2. add installers, each one decides if it's global or local
//! 7. compute actual BuildSteps from the current graph (a Binary will only induce an actual `cargo build`
//!    here if one of the Artifacts that was added requires outputs from it!)
//! 8. generate release/announcement notes
//!
//! During step 6 a lot of extra magic happens:
//!
//! * We drop artifacts on the ground if the current ArtifactMode disallows them
//! * We also try to automatically detect that a Binary That Needs To Be Built Now
//!   can produce symbols and make an Artifact for that too.
//!
//! In summary, the DistGraph has roughly the following hierarchy
//!
//! * Announcement: all the releases together
//!   * Releases: a specific version of an app (my-app-v1.0.0)
//!    * global Artifacts: artifacts that have only one version across all platforms
//!    * ReleaseVariants: a target-specific part of a Release (my-app-v1.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin)
//!      * local Artifacts: artifacts that are per-Variant
//!      * Binaries: a binary that should be built for a specific Variant
//!   * BuildSteps: steps we should take to build the artifacts
//!
//! Note that much of this hierarchy is rearranged/simplified in dist-manifest.json!
//!
//! Binaries are a little bit weird in that they are in principle nested under ReleaseVariants
//! but can/should be shared between them when possible (e.g. if you have a crash reporter
//! binary that's shared across various apps). This is... not well-supported and things will
//! go a bit wonky if you actually try to do this right now. Notably what to parent a Symbols
//! Artifact to becomes ambiguous! Probably we should just be fine with duplicating things in
//! this case..?
//!
//! Also note that most of these things have (ideally, unchecked) globally unique "ids"
//! that are used to create ids for things nested under them, to ensure final
//! artifacts/folders/files always have unique names.
//!
//! Also note that the BuildSteps for installers are basically monolithic "build that installer"
//! steps to give them the freedom to do whatever they need to do.

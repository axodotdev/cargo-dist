//! The dist 1.0 config format (as opposed to the old v0 format)
//!
//! This is the config subsystem!
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! It's responsible for loading, merging, and auto-detecting all the various config
//! sources. There are two closely related families of types:
//!
//! - `...Config` types are the "complete" values that will be passed around to the rest
//!   of the program. All of these types get shoved into the top-level [`Config`][] type.
//!
//! - `...Layer` types are "partial" values that are loaded and parsed before being merged
//!   into the final [`Config`][]. Notably the dist(-workspace).toml is loaded as [`TomlLayer`][].
//!
//! Nested types like [`WorkspaceInstallerConfig`][] usually have a paired layer ([`InstallerLayer`][]),
//! with an almost identical definition. The differences usually lie in the Layer having far more
//! Options, because you don't need to specify it in your oranda.json but we want the rest of our
//! code to have the final result fully resolved.
//!
//!
//! # The ORIGINAL Big Idea
//!
//! These ideas don't hold anymore but they're informative of how we ended up with the
//! current design. The next section discusses where we ended up and why.
//!
//! - a `...Config` type implements [`Default`][] manually to specify default values
//! - a `...Config` type implements [`ApplyLayer`][] to specify how its `...Layer` gets combined
//!
//! Conveniences like [`ApplyValExt::apply_val`][] and [`ApplyOptExt::apply_opt`][]
//! exist to help merge simple values like `bool <- Option<bool>` where overwriting the entire
//! value is acceptable.
//!
//! [`ApplyBoolLayerExt::apply_bool_layer`][] exists to apply [`BoolOr`][] wrappers
//! which lets config say things like `homebrew = false` when `HomebrewInstallerConfig`
//! is actually an entire struct.
//!
//!
//! # The ACTUAL Situation
//!
//! Here's how things are different from the original ideal design.
//!
//! ## Two Different Output Config Types
//!
//! Because we wanted to structurally distinguish "global" and "package-specific" configs
//! we ended up with two kinds of Config type: `Workspace...Config` and `App...Config`.
//! For instance [`WorkspaceInstallerConfig`][] and [`AppInstallerConfig`][] both exist.
//! Sometimes only one exists, because the struct would have no fields (because e.g. all the
//! relevant subconfig is all global).
//!
//!
//! ## Common Fields
//!
//! Some "common" fields are defined to be shared to several related things like
//! e.g. `ShellInstallerConfig` and `PowershellInstallerConfig`.
//!
//! These common fields are defined in `...Common` types. For instance [`CommonInstallerConfig`][]
//! and [`CommonInstallerLayer`][] specify the shared fields for all installers.
//!
//! Notably, as a convenience sugar, these common fields can be specified in the parent
//! struct and will be automatically "folded" into the subtypes. So you can set
//! `installers.success_msg = "hello"`` and this will be inherited by
//! `installers.powershell.success_msg` and `installers.shell.success_msg` and so on.
//!
//! In addition to being a sugar it also gives a forward-compat path for making a config
//! more granular in the future without breaking existing configs. So if success_msg
//! could only be set once for all installers, we could make it "common" *later*
//! to allow anyone to customize it without breaking any config from before then.
//!
//! ...HOWEVER...
//!
//! This is a huge thorn in the whole idea of starting with our final config with Default
//! and then folding in layers over time.
//!
//! This is because the "common" fields need to exist in the Layer types and be preserved
//! as we fold in all the fields *BUT* we want them to go away in the final Config types
//! because we want a single source of truth (we don't want code to forget to consult
//! the inheritance chain). So a bunch of places grew [`...ConfigInheritable`] types that
//! represent a hybrid between Config and Layer where the fields are ostensibly final
//! but the "common" fields are still not folded in.
//!
//! See for example [`InstallerConfigInheritable`][]. We actually construct *THESE*
//! instead of the `...Config` types, and then "finish" them with the apply_inheritance
//! methods.
//!
//!
//! ## Future Work
//!
//! The above situation is suboptimal and I believe the `...ConfigInheritable` types
//! are a mistake. We should instead just use the `...Layer` types as that type, and
//! apply defaults *at the end* instead of *at the start*.
//!
//! If you see a bunch of default code that doesn't make much sense, that's because
//! this refactor should be done because it really doesn't make sense.
//!
//! This is in theory not *complex* work, but it is *a bunch* of work.
//!
//! It's possible it would be more worthwhile to put the effort into a derive macro
//! that automates a bunch of this stuff if you're having to rejig a ton of the code/types
//! anyway.

// We very intentionally manually implement Default a lot in this submodule
// to keep things very explicit and clear

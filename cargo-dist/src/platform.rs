//! Logic for computing how different platforms are supported by a project's archives.
//!
//! The main entrypoint for this is [`PlatformSupport::new`][].
//! [`PlatformSupport::platforms`][] is what you want to query.
//!
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! The complexity of this module is trying to handle things like:
//!
//! * linux-musl-static binaries work on linux-gnu platforms
//! * but linux-gnu binaries are preferable if they're available
//! * but if the target system has a really old version of glibc, the linux-gnu binaries won't work
//! * so the linux-musl-static binaries need to still be eligible as a fallback
//!
//! ("x64 macos binaries can run on arm64 macos under rosetta2" is another good canonical example)
//!
//! [`PlatformSupport::platforms`][] is an index
//! from "target I want to install to" ([`TripleName`][])
//! to "list of archives we can potentially use to do that" ([`PlatformEntry`][]).
//! The list is sorted in decreasing order from best-to-worst options. The basic idea
//! is that you go down that list and try each option in order until one "works".
//! Typically there will only be one option, and that option will always work.
//!
//!
//!
//! ## SupportQuality
//!
//! We get *multiple* options when there are targets that interop, typically
//! with an emulation layer or some kind of compromise. The level of compromise
//! is captured by [`SupportQuality`][], which is what we sort the options by.
//! It can be found on [`PlatformEntry::quality`][].
//!
//! For instance, on linux-gnu, linux-gnu binaries have [`SupportQuality::HostNative`][] (best)
//! while linux-musl-static binaris have [`SupportQuality::ImperfectNative`][] (excellent).
//!
//! Note that this `SupportQuality` is specific to the target platform. For instance
//! x64 macos binaries are [`SupportQuality::HostNative`][] on x86_64-apple-darwin but
//! [`SupportQuality::Emulated`][] on aarch64-apple-darwin (they run via Rosetta 2).
//!
//!
//! ## RuntimeConditions
//!
//! A technically-superior option can *fail* if there are known runtime conditions for
//! it to execute properly on the install-target system, and the system doesn't satisfy
//! those conditions. These conditions are captured by [`RuntimeConditions`][].
//! It can be found on [`PlatformEntry::runtime_conditions`][].
//!
//! For instance, linux-gnu binaries are built against a specific version of glibc.
//! It can work with any glibc *newer* than that version, but it will hard error out
//! with a glibc *older* than that version.
//!
//! It's up to each installer to check these conditions to the best of their ability
//! and discard options that won't work. As of this writing, the shell installer
//! does the best job of this, because linux has the most relevant fallback/conditions.
//!
//!
//! ## Native RuntimeConditions
//!
//! Note that [`FetchableArchive::native_runtime_conditions`][] also exists but
//! **YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT THAT VALUE**. It contains runtime conditions that
//! are *intrinsic* to the archive, which is a subset of [`PlatformEntry::runtime_conditions`][].
//!
//! For instance the glibc version is intrinsic to a linux-gnu archive, and
//! is therefore a native_runtime_condition, so it will show up in both places.
//! However "must have Rosetta2 installed" isn't intrinsic to x64 macos binaries,
//! it *only* applies to "x64 macos binaries on arm64 macos", and so will *only*
//! appear in [`PlatformEntry::runtime_conditions`][].
//!
//!
//! # When To Invoke This Subsystem
//!
//! [`PlatformSupport::new`][] can be called at any time, and will do its best to produce
//! the best possible results with the information it has. However, the later
//! this function can be (re)run, the better information it will have.
//!
//! In particular, only once we have info from building and linkage-checking
//! the binaries will we have all the [`RuntimeConditions`][]. In a typical
//! CI run of dist this is fine, because the main use of this info
//! is for installers, which are built with a fresh invocation on a machine
//! with all binaries/platform info prefetched.
//!
//! However, if you were to run dist locally and try to build binaries
//! and installers all at once, we currently fail to regenerate the platform
//! info and update the installers. Doing this would necessitate some refactors
//! to make the installers compute more of their archive/platform info "latebound"
//! instead of the current very eager approach where we do that when building the
//! DistGraph.
//!
//! In an ideal world we do an initial invocation of this API when building the DistGraph
//! to get the list of platforms we expect to support (to know what an installer depends on),
//! and then after building all binarier/archives and running linkage, we would rerun
//! this API to get the final/complete picture. Then when we go to build installers we
//! would lookup the *details* of PlatformSupport.
//!
//!
//! # Compatibility Shims
//!
//! There's lots of things that care about platforms/archives, and they were written
//! before this module. As of this writing we're in the process of gradually migrating
//! them to using the full power of this API.
//!
//! To enable that migration, the PlatformSupport has a few APIs that will squash its
//! richer information into legacy/simpler ones. In an ideal world we stop using these
//! APIs and migrate all installers to just Doing It Right (but Doing It Right
//! moves more logic into each installer, as it essentially requires each installer
//! to have a full implementation for how to query [`PlatformSupport::platforms`][]
//! and do the RuntimeCondition fallbacks.
//!
//!
//! ## Fragments
//!
//! Fragments is the old platform support format that this API was made to replace.
//!
//! [`PlatformSupport::fragments`][] throws out all the fallback/condition information
//! to produce a list of archives, each with a single target it claims to support.
//! In cases where e.g. you have linux-musl-static build but no linux-gnu build, we
//! will emit multiple copies of the linux-musl-static archive, one for each platform
//! it's the best option for (so typically 3 copies covering linux-musl-static,
//! linux-musl-dynamic, and linux-gnu).
//!
//! This system is a lot easier for an installer to handle, because all it needs to
//! do is compute the target-triple it wants to try to install, and get the one
//! archive that claims to support that (or error if none).
//!
//! Historically things like musl fallback were implemented in an installer during
//! its target-triple selection with a single global hardcoded glibc version.
//!
//!
//! ## Conflated Runtime Conditions
//!
//! [`PlatformSupport::safe_conflated_runtime_conditions`][] and
//! [`PlatformSupport::conflated_runtime_conditions`][] exist to deal with
//! installers that have the above "single global hardcoded glibc version"
//! mentioned in the previous section.
//!
//! It represents a half-step to removing that, by removing the "hardcoded"
//! part, having the version be baked into the installer when we generate it.
//!
//! The "conflation" occurs when you have multiple linux-gnu platforms.
//! This is typical if you build for x64 and arm64 linux. In this case, the
//! runners may have different glibc versions, so there's no "correct"
//! global hardcoded version.
//!
//! Conflated conditions handle this by taking the maximum, which is *safe*
//! but may prevent people from installing on a compatible system (see
//! the next section for details).
//!
//!
//! # The Importance of Glibc Versions
//!
//! Getting the right glibc version is important because it's used to:
//!
//! * Trigger musl fallback in installers if your glibc is too new
//! * Informatively error out installers if there is no musl fallback
//!
//! If the version is wrong, there are two kinds of failure mode.
//!
//! If this version is too new, we may spuriously error during install for overly
//! strict constraints, preventing users from installing the application at all.
//! If there is a musl-static fallback this isn't a concern, and instead we'll just
//! overly-aggressively use the musl fallback (though it's mildly unfortunate that
//! a "more native" option is available and unused).
//!
//! If this version is too old we will fail to error and/or fail to invoke musl fallback,
//! and may claim to successfully install linux-gnu binaries which will immediately error out
//! when run.
//!
//!
//! ### Madeup Glibc Versions
//!
//! There is currently a FIXME in `native_runtime_conditions_for_artifact` about us making up a fake
//! glibc version if we can't find one, but we're clearing supposed to be linking linux-gnu.
//!
//! Under ideal conditions this only is "transiently" used when we're too-eagerly looking up
//! runtime conditions, or doing tests without linkage info. As such, they
//! generally won't appear in final production installers.
//! In this case they will get an "arbitrary" glibc version ([`LibcVersion::default_glibc`][]).
//!
//! *HOWEVER* there are genuine situations where we don't run linkage in production.
//! For instance, if the archives were built and packaged in custom build
//! steps, because the user wanted to use maturin for cross-compilation.
//!
//!
//! ### Approximating Glibc Versions
//!
//! To the best of our knowledge, there is no way to "ask" a binary what version of glibc
//! it's linked against (if this is wrong PLEASE let us know that would be so useful).
//! It will tell you it's linked against glibc, but not the version
//! (there's a version in the library name but that never changes and is therefore irrelevant).
//!
//! We approximate the answer by asking the glibc on the system that built the binary
//! "hey what version are you" and then *ASSUME ALL BINARIES BUILT ON THAT PLATFORM WERE
//! BUILT AGAINST IT*.
//!
//! This is the default for most toolchains and is correct in 99% of cases.
//! However, some tools may go above and beyond to try to link against older glibcs.
//! Tools such as maturin and zig do this. In this case we are likely to pick a too-new
//! glibc version, see the previous sections for the implications of this.
//! It's possible in the case of maturin you "just" need to check the glibc in the
//! docker image it used? This is a guess though.
//!
//!
//! # targets vs target
//!
//! Ok so a lot of dist's code is *vaguely* trying to allow for a single archive
//! to *natively* be built for multiple architectures. This would for instance be the
//! case for any apple Universal Binary, which is just several binaries built for different
//! architectures all stapled together.
//!
//! This is why you'll see several places where an archive/binary has `targets`, *plural*.
//!
//! In practice this is headache inducing, and because nothing we support *actually*
//! is like this, code variously has punted on supporting it, or asserts against it.
//! As such, there's a lot of random places where we use `target`, *singular*.
//! Typically `target` is just `targets[0]`.
//!
//! So anyway it would be cool if code tried to work with `targets` but if you see stuff
//! only using target, or weirdly throwing out parts of targets... that's why.
//!
//! In theory *this* is the module that would handle it for everyone else, because once
//! we've constructed [`PlatformSupport`][] the information is indexed such that the
//! difference doesn't actually matter (nothing should care what platform an archive
//! is *natively* for, they should just do whatever [`PlatformSupport::platforms`][] says).
//!
//! But until we care about universal binaries, it's not really worth dealing with.

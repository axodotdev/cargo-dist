/// On Linux it's preferred to dynamically link libc *but* because the One True ABI
/// is actually the Linux kernel syscall interface, you *can* theoretically statically
/// link libc. This comes with various tradeoffs but the big selling point is that the
/// Linux kernel is a much more slowly moving target, so you can build a binary
/// that's portable across way more systems by statically linking libc. As such,

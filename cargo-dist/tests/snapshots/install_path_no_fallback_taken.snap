The installer for axolotlsay 0.2.2

This script detects what platform you're on and fetches an appropriate archive from
https://github.com/axodotdev/axolotlsay/releases/download/v0.2.2
then unpacks the binaries and installs them to the first of the following locations

    \$HOME/.axolotlsay
    \$MY_ENV_VAR/My Axolotlsay Documents/bin

It will then add that dir to PATH by adding the appropriate line to your shell profiles.

USAGE:
    axolotlsay-installer.sh [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -v, --verbose
            Enable verbose output

    -q, --quiet
            Disable progress output

        --no-modify-path
            Don't configure the PATH environment variable

    -h, --help
            Print help information

# See discussion of late-bound vs early-bound for why we use single-quotes with env vars
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
install() {
    # This code needs to both compute certain paths for itself to write to, and
    # also write them to shell/rc files so that they can look them up to e.g.
    # add them to PATH. This requires an active distinction between paths
    # and expressions that can compute them.
    #
    # The distinction lies in when we want env-vars to be evaluated. For instance
    # if we determine that we want to install to $HOME/.myapp, which do we add
    # to e.g. $HOME/.profile:
    #
    # * early-bound: export PATH="/home/myuser/.myapp:$PATH"
    # * late-bound:  export PATH="$HOME/.myapp:$PATH"
    #
    # In this case most people would prefer the late-bound version, but in other
    # cases the early-bound version might be a better idea. In particular when using
    # other env-vars than $HOME, they are more likely to be only set temporarily
    # for the duration of this install script, so it's more advisable to erase their
    # existence with early-bounding.
    #
    # This distinction is handled by "double-quotes" (early) vs 'single-quotes' (late).
    #
    # However if we detect that "$SOME_VAR/..." is a subdir of $HOME, we try to rewrite
    # it to be '$HOME/...' to get the best of both worlds.
    #
    # This script has a few different variants, the most complex one being the
    # CARGO_HOME version which attempts to install things to Cargo's bin dir,
    # potentially setting up a minimal version if the user hasn't ever installed Cargo.
    #
    # In this case we need to:
    #
    # * Install to $HOME/.cargo/bin/
    # * Create a shell script at $HOME/.cargo/env that:
    #   * Checks if $HOME/.cargo/bin/ is on PATH
    #   * and if not prepends it to PATH
    # * Edits $HOME/.profile to run $HOME/.cargo/env (if the line doesn't exist)
    #
    # To do this we need these 4 values:

    # The actual path we're going to install to
    local _install_dir
    # The install prefix we write to the receipt.
    # For organized install methods like CargoHome, which have
    # subdirectories, this is the root without `/bin`. For other

The installer for axolotlsay 0.2.2

.DESCRIPTION

This script detects what platform you're on and fetches an appropriate archive from
https://github.com/axodotdev/axolotlsay/releases/download/v0.2.2
then unpacks the binaries and installs them to the first of the following locations

    $HOME/.axolotlsay
    $env:MY_ENV_VAR/My Axolotlsay Documents/bin

It will then add that dir to PATH by editing your Environment.Path registry key

.PARAMETER ArtifactDownloadUrl
The URL of the directory where artifacts can be fetched from

.PARAMETER NoModifyPath
Don't add the install directory to PATH

.PARAMETER Help
Print help

The installer for {{ app_name }} {{ app_version }}

This script detects what platform you're on and fetches an appropriate archive from
{{ base_url }}
then unpacks the binaries and installs them to {% if install_path.kind == "CargoHome" -%}
    \$CARGO_HOME/bin (\$HOME/.cargo/bin)
{%- elif install_path.kind == "HomeSubdir" -%}
    \$HOME/{{ install_path.subdir }}

    \${{ install_path.env_key }}/{{ install_path.subdir }}
{%- else -%}
    {{ error("unimplemented install_path format: " ~ install_path.kind) }}

It will then add that dir to PATH by adding the appropriate line to your shell profiles.

# See discussion of late-bound vs early-bound for why we use single-quotes with env vars
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
install() {
    # This code needs to both compute certain paths for itself to write to, and
    # also write them to shell/rc files so that they can look them up to e.g.
    # add them to PATH. This requires an active distinction between paths
    # and expressions that can compute them.
    #
    # The distinction lies in when we want env-vars to be evaluated. For instance
    # if we determine that we want to install to $HOME/.myapp, which do we add
    # to e.g. $HOME/.profile:
    #
    # * early-bound: export PATH="/home/myuser/.myapp:$PATH"
    # * late-bound:  export PATH="$HOME/.myapp:$PATH"
    #
    # In this case most people would prefer the late-bound version, but in other
    # cases the early-bound version might be a better idea. In particular when using
    # other env-vars than $HOME, they are more likely to be only set temporarily
    # for the duration of this install script, so it's more advisable to erase their
    # existence with early-bounding.
    #
    # This distinction is handled by "double-quotes" (early) vs 'single-quotes' (late).
    #
    # This script has a few different variants, the most complex one being the
    # CARGO_HOME version which attempts to install things to Cargo's bin dir,
    # potentially setting up a minimal version if the user hasn't ever installed Cargo.
    #
    # In this case we need to:
    #
    # * Install to $HOME/.cargo/bin/
    # * Create a shell script at $HOME/.cargo/env that:
    #   * Checks if $HOME/.cargo/bin/ is on PATH
    #   * and if not prepends it to PATH
    # * Edits $HOME/.profile to run $HOME/.cargo/env (if the line doesn't exist)
    #
    # To do this we need these 4 values:

    # The actual path we're going to install to
    local _install_dir
    # Path to the an shell script that adds install_dir to PATH
    local _env_script_path

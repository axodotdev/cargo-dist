# Code of Conduct

The repositories within the @axodotdev GitHub organization are formally owned
by Axo Developer Co. which is a for-profit C-Corporation incorporated in
Delaware, USA and operated by its global, distributed, team of employees.

To the extent it is possible, reasonable, and legal, external contributors and
employees are held to the same behavior standards, as defined by the 
[Contributor Covenant]'s Pledge and Standards.

Enforcement will necessarily be different depending on the employment status
of involved parties.

All decisions are made by [Ashley Williams](mailto:ashley@axo.dev) through a 
consensus-seeking process with the [Axo team](https://www.axo.dev/team) and
to the extent it is possible, reasonable, and legal, any involved external
participants.

# * builds binaries/packages
# * uploads those packages to the release

# Note that the release will be created before the packages,

# This task will run whenever you push a github tag that looks like
# a version number. We just look for `v` followed by at least one number
# and then whatever. so `v1`, `v1.0.0`, and `v1.0.0-prerelease` all work.

# TODO: github has a way to mark a Github Release™️ as a "prerelease".
# haven't checked if taiki-e/create-gh-release-action auto-detects and applies
# this, but I've implemented it manually before if not.
